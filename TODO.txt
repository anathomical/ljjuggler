TO DO for Firefox port:

- Finish porting (fix the JSON.parse error thrown by background.js when trying to add a new account)
- Fix/update any other code that hasn't been fixed.
- Update icons for Firefox (I could maybe try making a logo since I like to Photoshop)
- See if adding support for Tumblr accounts is possible.
