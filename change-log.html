		<p>LJ Juggler</p>
		<p>A Google Chrome extension for switching between user accounts on LiveJournal.</p>
		<p><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/">http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/</a></p>
		<p>As always, feel free to send questions, concerns, comments, or suggestions via email to <a href="mailto:rushin.doll@gmail.com">rushin.doll@gmail.com</a>.

		<h3><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/ljjuggler3-0-0.crx">Version 3.0.0</a></h3>
			<p>User-facing</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When adding a new account on the options page, users now select which of the supported sites the account is for.  (If you know of other sites you'd like to see supported, let us know.  They're pretty easy to add.)</li>
				<li>Modified the highlighting behavior of the UI to show all accounts you are logged into across all services.  This can result in multiple accounts listed as "logged in".</li>
				<li>This is less a change than a not-change, but it's worth mentioning.  The login interface does not differentiate between services.  All accounts are listed alphabetically.  This means that if you use multiple services your accounts will be all mixed together.  We're pondering a UI fix on this one, so again if you have suggestions, let us know.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Behind-the-scenes</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Early-stage LJ clone support.  The system now allows users to register accounts for LJ clone sites, not just LiveJournal.com.</li>
				<li>Complete overhaul of the behind-the-scenes account highlighting logic.  It's significantly more efficient, and more accurate now.  It also handles highlighting for multiple accounts now.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/ljjuggler2-2-0.crx">Version 2.2.0</a></h3>
			<p>User-facing</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When removing an account on the options page, LJ Juggler now asks you to click a confirmation button before deleting it, just in case you accidentally hit the X.</li>
				<li>When adding a new account on the options page, LJ Juggler confirms that the username and password you provide can actually be used to log in.  This helps save you from typos and solves error-checking problems later on.</li>
				<li>When you add a new account on the options page, LJ Juggler <strong>automatically logs you into that account</strong>.  We're not sure this is a feature, it might well be a bug (let us know!), but it was the easiest way to handle the validation of accounts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Behind-the-scenes</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Added a response-code parsing function for login attempts.  LJ Juggler can now do more than just fail to log in if something goes wrong, it can try to tell developers why (in the console).</li>
				<li>Moved version check and update code into background.html.  This actually saves a LOT of CPU cycles since previously there was a fairly involved asynchronous version check every time you opened the Juggler window.</li>
				<li>Some general code clean up that hopefully paves the way for adding support for LJ clone sites.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/ljjuggler2-1-2.crx">Version 2.1.2</a></h3>
			<p>User-facing</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Minor UI tweak: modified highlight behavior so that it is slightly more consistent and has slightly higher visibility.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Added a feature to make site-scheme selection permanent.  In previous versions it was a session-length cookie and would expire (and need to be reset) when your browser closed.  Now if you set one, it'll stick around for a year.  Currently the system will use the same sitescheme for ALL accounts.  If different schemes for different accounts is really important to you, let me know and I'll see what I can do!</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug in the cookie expiration calculator so now all cookies set last one year instead of until February of 40572 or some other insane date.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/ljjuggler2-1-1.crx">Version 2.1.1</a></h3>
			<p>User-facing</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tweaked CSS so that the mouse pointer stays as a pointer object rather than converting to a cursor when hovering over the user-option that you are currently logged in as.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/ljjuggler2-1-0.crx">Version 2.1.0</a></h3>
			<p>User-facing</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Minor tweak to differentiate between a selected account that is currently highlighted because the user is hovering the mouse over it, and one that is not highlighted but still selected.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Behind-the-scenes</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Generated a localStorage passing handler so that background.html can handle all localStorage requests from any page in the extension.</li>
				<li>Used an update check to move all the localStorage data to background.html's store so that it's in one place.</li>
				<li>Tweaked popup.html and options.html so that they use the localStorage set up in background.html.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/ljjuggler2-0-4.crx">Version 2.0.4</a></h3>
			<p>User-facing</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Numerous tweaks to clean up visual elements.</li>
				<li>Modified highlighting behavior per user-feedback.</li>
				<li>Added a link to access account management/options page directly from the extension.</li>
				<li>Added links to the web presence for the extension.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Behind-the-scenes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Cleaned up the user-option generating code to be cleaner and slightly more efficient.</li>
				<li>Extensive changes to the highlight logic code to make it more flexible and standardized.</li>
				<li>Shifted the logout (and other option DIVs) from dynamic generation to static generation for easier non-coder modification/duplication.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/ljjuggler2-0-3.crx">Version 2.0.3</a></h3>
			<p>User-facing:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Minor tweaks for text visibility on non-Mac systems.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/ljjuggler2-0-1.crx">Version 2.0.1</a></h3>
			<p>User-facing:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User interface significantly prettified thanks to <a href="http://metanomaly.livejournal.com">Metanomaly</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3><a href="http://rushin-doll.net/lj-juggler/ljjuggler2-0-0.crx">Version 2.0.0</a></h3>
			<p>User-facing:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A pop-up alert to appear whenever the extension updates to a new version.</li>
				<li>Changed logout procedures so that only the current session is ended.  This fixes the long-standing problem that would cause LJ Juggler to interfere with other instances of itself on other machines or with instances of ljlogin on Firefox, or with just about any other login system.  They should all play nice now.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Behind-the-scenes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Instituted a background page and moved most of the code to it for efficiency and to allow users to do other things while logins change.</li>
				<li>Changed password storage to store hashes rather than plaintext for slightly better local security.</li>
				<li>Shifted to cookie-based login and authentication (the same model used by ljlogin for Firefox).  Security bump, much more accurate at recognizing which account is logged in, and noticeable speed increase.</li>
			</ul>
