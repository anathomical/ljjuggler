A port of the Chrome extension for Firefox to replace the defunct LJLogin, largely made possible and easier by Mozilla's new WebExtensions.

Original README:
LJ Juggler is an extension for Google Chrome that allows for easy switching between accounts.

It's a total hack-job.  While little actual code was used from the LJlogin project (http://ljlogin.e-space.gweep.net/), a large debt of gratitude is owed them since looking through their code helped with understanding the LiveJournal authenticaion process as well as figuring out how to structure this code.
