LJ Juggler is an extension for Google Chrome that allows for easy switching between accounts.

It's a total hack-job.  While no code was used from the LJlogin project (an add-on for Firefox which does something similar, only much more cleanly), a large debt of gratitude is owed them since looking through their code helped with understanding the LiveJournal authenticaion process as well as figuring out how to structure this code.

Some of the choices made in the code here are forced by the still-in-progress nature of some Chrome extension APIs.  Specifically the lack of non-dev cookie manipulation means that all cookie exchange has to be handled through server calls.
