TO DO for Firefox port:

- Find workaround for popup resizing in Firefox until the Firefox bug is (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1215025) is fixed.
-- > Doesn't seem to be a workaround so this is a known issue. The popup is now a larger static height until the bug is fixed.

- See if adding support for Tumblr accounts is possible.
- See about a Firefox mobile version.
